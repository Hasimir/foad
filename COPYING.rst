Copying and Licensing
=====================

Copies of the licenses under which this software is distributed are
located in the Licenses directory.  Greater detail as it relates to
contributions or other uses are detailed in the docs.

Original releases (2013-2014) were dual licensed under the GPLv3 and
the WTFNMFPLv1.  From 2015 onward the software continued to be
licensed this way, but also licensed under the three clause BSD
license to account for using it as a library.  The LGPL 2.1 and Apache
2.0 licenses are also under consideration, but can wait for now.

Users may accept any one or combination of these licenses, but
contributors (in the unlikely event that there are any) must
contribute according to the terms of all of them for code to be
accepted (so it can continue to be offered under the same terms).

While there may be a valid argument that the terms of the WTFNMFPLv1
are enough to allow distribution under any other license, it just
makes things easier to know that they're all covered explicitly.

Since this project could be used as a module and imported into
something else, any contributions offered solely under the terms of
the GPL will be rejected since the GPL prevents the use of dynamic
linking in non-GPL or non-GPL compliant projects.  I believe foad.py
has a number of appropriate responses for people who insist on using
the GPL or the GPL Affero licenses for library modules.

Making a pull request will be interpreted to mean you are submitting
code under the terms of all the licenses under which the project is
distributed at that time.
