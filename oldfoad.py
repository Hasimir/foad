# Version:  0.5.5.2a

# BTC:  1NpzDJg2pXjSqCL3XHTcyYaehiBN3kG3Lz

#
# Requirements:
#
# * Python 3.2 or later (developed with Python 3.4.x)
# * Python modules: argparse, random, sys, textwrap
#
# Versions up to 0.4.x developed with Python 2.7.x.  Conversion to
# Python 3 made from version 0.4.2.
#
# Options and notes:
#
# Based on Fuck Off As A Service (FOAAS)
# https://foaas.herokuapp.com/
#
# Includes the same options and many more beyond those.
#
# As the name suggests, most of the output involves the many uses of
# the word "fuck", but some options do not use it.  Running the
# unittest will display the output for all options and show which
# options do not use the word "fuck".
#
# The unittest will display the correct output for almost everything.
#
# The "sherlock" option if it is run with "Sherlock" or "Sherlock
# Holmes" as the target will only produce one result normally, but the
# unittest won't pick that up properly.  The "random" option, however,
# will give the correct output if it happens to hit that option with
# that target.
#
# The acronyms options also does not behave like the main options,
# instead it uses the the target parameter to look up different
# definitions.
#
# Using the acronym option without a target displays an introduction.
# Using the acronym option with a target not specifically addressed
# displays the list of target parameters which can be used with that
# option.  Using any of the listed target parameters will display the
# relevant definition.
#
# There are three options on Latin.  The "priapus" options include
# translation in the "priapus_trans1" and "priapus_trans2" options
# (priapus_trans2 no target contains the translation for priapus no
# target and priapus_trans1 contains the best translation for priapus
# with a target, the other variants are potentially useful).  The
# "omnia" and "vvv" options include translations in comments in the
# source code.
#
# Old Usage:  oldfoad.py donut foo
#             oldfoad.py outside "FirstName LastName"
#             oldfoad.py king FirstName LastName
#
# Old X-Chat/IRC usage:  /exec -o oldfoad.py donut foo
#                        /exec -o oldfoad.py outside "FirstName LastName"
#                        /exec -o oldfoad.py king FirstName LastName
#
# Calling foad.py in other Python scripts (e.g. Twython for Twitter)
# should be performed with the subprocess module.  Methods for doing
# so are left as an exercise to the reader.
#
# If foad.py is added to site-packages, further help can be obtained
# with pydoc3 (or by running that command in the same directory as the
# script).
#
# Python Documentation help command: pydoc3 foad
