FOAD: Fucked Off Adversarial Degenerates
========================================

Text based script for readily insulting people intended to be run from
the command line or in IRC. Can be incorporated into other scripts, such
as `Twython Tools <https://github.com/adversary-org/twython-tools>`__.

To use it run: foad.py [-h/--help] -f/--fuck option [-n/--name target]
[-s/--sender from] [-e/--extra "some paramater"] [-p/--prepend "text
before insult"] [-a/--append "text after insult"]

Examples:

::

    bash$ ./foad.py -f wtfwjd
    What the fuck would Jesus do?
    bash$ ./foad.py -f wtfwjdrtfm -n Bob
    So Bob, what the fuck would Jesus do?  Jesus would read the fucking manual!
    bash$ ./foad.py -f mind -n "Joe Biden"
    Joe Biden, are you out of your fucking mind?!
    bash$ foad -f psycho3 -n "Tony Abbott"
    Tony Abbott, you're a fucking megalomaniacal, malignantly narcissistic, psychopath!
    bash$ 

There are currently more than 200 options to use with the -f flag and
the majority of those have two or more forms, one for naming a subject,
a more general one and occasionally a sender or extra text or other
parameter included. As well as a couple of special options which are
more informative than insulting. The full list of options is visible on
the command line by running "foad.py -f list\_options" and the test
script will generate most of the possible output. All options and the
generic catchall can now be used with --prepend and/or --append.

If you find this script of use or even just amusing, a small Bitcoin
contribution to 1NpzDJg2pXjSqCL3XHTcyYaehiBN3kG3Lz would be appreciated.

Installing
----------

All you need to do to install this script is download foad.py and move
it to somewhere in your path. See the Requirements section for the
version of Python required. To import it as a module in Python it needs
to be in your Python path (e.g. site-packages). I usually just leave it
in /usr/local/bin or $HOME/bin with an appropriately adjusted .bashrc or
.bash\_profile configuration.

The script should be obtained from here:

https://github.com/adversary-org/foad

Requirements
------------

-  Python 3.2 and above.
-  Only utilises standard modules (argparse, sys, random and a couple of
   others).
-  Utilises the new standard for string formatting as of version 0.7.
